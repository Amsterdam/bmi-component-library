# BMI Component Library

A React component library based on [Amsterdam Styled Components](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam-styled-components) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) specifically aimed at repurposing and sharing domain specific components across BMI projects.

NOTE: If you are looking for a component library that is primarily focused on providing you with building blocks which are aligned with the [Amsterdam Design System](https://designsystem.amsterdam.nl/7awj1hc9f/p/39359e-design-system), then take a look at [Amsterdam Styled Components](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam-styled-components) instead.
